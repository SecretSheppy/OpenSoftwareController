# Open Software Controller

Open Software Controller is essentially a launcher that can be used to make
downloading, installing and managing open source software much easier, 
particularly for those who are not familiar with building software from source.

## A note on commit history

This project was originally going to be a simple prototype, but has since
become a full-fledged project. As a result, the commit history before commit
4cc08dd is a bit of a mess. This shouldn't cause any problems as the project
is currently far from complete, but for those wanting to see how it developed
over time, it may cause some confusion. Going forward, conventional commits will
be used.
